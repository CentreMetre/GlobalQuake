# GlobalQuake

## Updates

GlobalQuake 0.9.0 has just been released! Read about the new features in the [releases section](https://github.com/xspanger3770/GlobalQuake/releases)

## Description

GlobalQuake is my experimental Java application that can be used to monitor earthquakes world-wide in real time.

Enables selection of seismic stations from publicly available seismic networks - `fdsnws services`. \
Real time data is supplied by `seedlink` networks. \
The program then uses the data to detect earthquakes and visualize them on 3D global interactive map.
It can also quickly estimate the earthquake magnitude using some empirical methods, but this only works for small and medium quakes up to magnitude 5-6.

Project is in early development state and there is quite some room for improvement in many of the features.

### Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated
